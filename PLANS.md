## CURRENT WORK (v0.3 - PDF Generation Backend)

**Next Steps**:
1. Install WeasyPrint/ReportLab for PDF generation
2. Design PDF template matching LOWDOWN aesthetic (enhanced)
3. Convert briefing JSON → HTML → PDF
4. Store PDFs in Supabase blob storage (or local for now)
5. Create GET /briefing/latest/pdf endpoint
6. Test PDF generation with v0.2 briefing
7. Validate PDF quality (15-20 pages expected)

## DEFERRED WORK (Post-v0.2)

### Scraper Fixes (v0.3 or later)

**Defense One** (`api/scrapers/defenseone_scraper.py`):
- Status: Scaffold created, selectors untested
- Issue: HTML selectors need debugging (likely similar to ISW fix)
- Estimated: 1-2h to fix selectors and test
- Priority: Medium (ISW covers enough sources for v0.2.2)

**Breaking Defense** (`api/scrapers/breakingdefense_scraper.py`):
- Status: Scaffold created, selectors untested
- Issue: HTML selectors need debugging
- Estimated: 1-2h to fix selectors and test
- Priority: Medium

**IISS** (`api/scrapers/iiss_scraper.py`):
- Status: Scaffold created, selectors untested
- Issue: HTML selectors need debugging
- Estimated: 1-2h to fix selectors and test
- Priority: Medium

**How to Fix**:
1. Run debug script (similar to `api/debug_isw.py`)
2. Inspect HTML structure with BeautifulSoup
3. Find correct selectors for:
   - Article list items
   - Title links
   - Date elements
   - Content container
4. Update scraper selectors
5. Test and validate JSON output

## TECHNICAL NOTES

### Scraping Lessons Learned

**What Worked**:
- Playwright alone (no CloakBrowser needed for open sources)
- Base scraper class with retry logic and JSON export
- Parallel execution with error handling (orchestrator pattern)
- Region inference from keywords in content

**Selector Patterns** (for future scrapers):
- ISW: `h3 a` for titles, `article` for content
- Date parsing: Regex from title text when not in dedicated element
- Content cleaning: Remove `script`, `style`, `nav`, `footer`, `header`

**Debugging Process**:
1. Create debug script to fetch page HTML
2. Use BeautifulSoup to test selectors
3. Save HTML to file for manual inspection if needed
4. Update scraper with working selectors

**Common Issues**:
- Sites use different HTML structures (no standard)
- Selectors are fragile and break when sites update
- Date formats vary widely across sources
- Paywalls may require CloakBrowser (not needed yet)

## COST TRACKING

**v0.2.1 Costs**: $0 (Playwright is free, scraping is local)  
**v0.2.2 Expected**: $0-0.50 (Gemini free tier, DeepSeek fallback ~$0.014/briefing)

---

## SESSION NOTES

**2026-05-23**:
- Completed v0.2.1 scraper infrastructure
- ISW scraper fully working (16 articles, 400KB JSON)
- Fixed HTML selectors after initial test failures
- Deferred other 3 scrapers to post-v0.2
- Starting v0.2.2 (LLM Synthesis)

---

## STOP EVENT RESUME

If session stops during v0.2.2:
- ISW scraper working: `data/scraped/isw_2026-05-23.json`
- Resume with: `/start` → continue v0.2.2 synthesis work
